# Video Search Engine

## Project Overview

The **Video Search Engine** is a sophisticated application that integrates MongoDB and MySQL to deliver a seamless video search experience. This project leverages the capabilities of both databases to manage video indexing and relational information effectively.

## Features

### Database Management
- **MongoDB**: Used for indexing video files. The application utilizes the provided video dataset (`dataset.tar`) for MongoDB. You can also enrich the database by adding your favorite videos in JSON format.
- **MySQL**: Handles relational data, such as click-through information, enabling effective tracking of user interactions with the video content.

### User Interface Components
The GUI of the application includes the following key components:
- **Search Query Panel (SQP)**: A dedicated area for users to submit their video search queries.
- **Search Button (SB)**: A button that initiates the search based on the user's input in the SQP.
- **Search Result Panel (SRP)**: Displays the results of the video search, allowing users to view relevant videos based on their queries.
- **Current Video Panel (CVP)**: Shows the video currently selected by the user for viewing.
